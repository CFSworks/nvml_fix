\mainpage NVML API Reference

The NVIDIA Management Library (NVML) is a C-based programmatic interface for monitoring and 
managing various states within NVIDIA Tesla &tm; GPUs.<br>It is intended to be a platform for building
3rd party applications, and is also the underlying library for the NVIDIA-supported nvidia-smi
tool.<br>NVML is thread-safe so it is safe to make simultaneous NVML calls from multiple threads.

<h2 align="center">API Documentation</h2>
<p>
Supported OS platforms:
- Windows: Windows Server 2008 R2 64bit, Windows 7 64bit
- Linux: 32-bit and 64-bit

Supported products:
- Full Support
    - NVIDIA Tesla &tm; Line:   S1070, S2050, C1060, C2050/70/75, M2050/70/75/90, X2070/90
    - NVIDIA Quadro &reg; Line:  4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, M2070-Q
    - NVIDIA GeForce &reg; Line: None
- Limited Support
    - NVIDIA Tesla &tm; Line:   None
    - NVIDIA Quadro &reg; Line:  All other current and previous generation Quadro-branded parts
    - NVIDIA GeForce &reg; Line: All current and previous generation GeForce-branded parts

The NVML library can be found at \%ProgramW6432\%\\"NVIDIA Corporation"\\NVSMI\\ on Windows, but
will not be added to the path. To dynamically link to NVML, add this path to the PATH environmental
variable. To dynamically load NVML, call LoadLibrary with this path.

On Linux the NVML library will be found on the standard library path. For 64 bit Linux, both the 32 bit
and 64 bit NVML libraries will be installed.

The NVML API is divided into five categories:
- Support Methods:
    - \ref nvmlInitializationAndCleanup 
- Query Methods:
    - \ref nvmlSystemQueries 
    - \ref nvmlDeviceQueries 
    - \ref nvmlUnitQueries 
- Control Methods:
    - \ref nvmlUnitCommands 
    - \ref nvmlDeviceCommands 
- Event Handling Methods:
    - \ref nvmlEvents
- Error reporting Methods
    - \ref nvmlErrorReporting

List of changes can be found in the \ref Changelog
